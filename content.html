Pseudocode is a simplified, human-readable way to describe the steps in an algorithm or program without using the syntax of a specific programming language. It focuses on the logic and structure of the code rather than the exact details of implementation.

The example below illustrates how pseudocode can be used to outline a simple algorithm that calculates the sum of the first 10 natural numbers:

<pre><code>START
    SET sum TO 0
    FOR i FROM 1 TO 10 DO
        sum = sum + i
    END FOR
    PRINT sum
END
</code></pre>

There are no strict rules for writing pseudocode, and it's common to see variations in style. Sometimes these reflect the background of the author or audience, or can be tailored to what is being demonstrated.
